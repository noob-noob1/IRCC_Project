Net Migration

Formula: Total PRs + Total TRs
Represents the sum of Permanent Residents (PRs) and Temporary Residents (TRs). If either PRs or TRs is 0, the value is set to 0.
Natural Increase

Formula: Total Births - Total Deaths
Measures the population growth due to births exceeding deaths. If either births or deaths is 0, the value is set to 0.
Net Population Change

Formula: Net Migration + Natural Increase
Represents the total change in population from both migration and natural increase. If either Net Migration or Natural Increase is 0, this value is also set to 0.
Net Migration Rate

Formula: (Net Migration / Population Estimate) * 100
Expressed as a percentage, it represents the proportion of population change due to migration.
Natural Growth Rate

Formula: (Natural Increase / Population Estimate) * 100
Expressed as a percentage, it represents the proportion of population change due to natural increase (births minus deaths).
Population Growth Rate (%)

Formula: (Net Population Change / Population Estimate) * 100
Measures the overall population growth rate as a percentage.
Net Migration %

Formula: (Net Migration / (Net Migration + Natural Increase)) * 100
Shows the contribution of migration to total population growth.
Natural Increase %

Formula: (Natural Increase / (Net Migration + Natural Increase)) * 100
Shows the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to total population growth.
Net Population Change %

Formula: (Net Population Change / (Net Migration + Natural Increase)) * 100
Represents the overall population change as a percentage of total migration and natural increase.
