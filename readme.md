# IRCC Population Forecasting Project: Predicting Temporary and Permanent Residents in Canada

## Project Description
A team together with Immigration Refugees Citizenship Canada (IRCC) conducts this project which analyzes past population data to predict the future numbers of Temporary Residents (TR) and Permanent Residents (PR) in Canada. This project provides strategic and policy-making assistance through its derived insights to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada authorities.

## Objectives
- Examine previous records regarding Temporary Residents and Permanent Residents in Canada.
- The project develops forecasting models which produce predictions about TR and PR population growth for future times.
- A user-friendly interaction tool(eg., dashboard/streamlit app)should be created for interactive visualization of predictions.
- The project delivers fieldable recommendations for helping IRCC direct their resources while making effective planning policies.

## Data Sources

- Official IRCC immigration datasets
- Canadian Open Government Portal
- Historical population statistics
- Project Workflow

## Completed Tasks:

- Data Collection and Initial Exploration
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Baseline predictive model development served as the starting point of the workflow.
- Team created a prototype for the population forecasting tool through the utilization of Streamlit library.


## Upcoming Tasks:

- Model Validation and Optimization
- The implementation of modern forecasting engines including ARIMA, Prophet and various Machine Learning algorithms
- Deployment of finalized forecasting application


## Methodology & Technologies

- The data analysis and modeling components of the project operate through Python tools which include Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels and Prophet.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
- **Web Application**: Streamlit for interactive forecasting visualization
- **Collaboration Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code

## Predictive Modeling

Different forecasting approaches were applied during the process including:

- Time Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Regression-based models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

A selection process for the most dependable forecasting approach continues as baseline models have already been built.


## Current Results & Insights

- Trends identified to be consistent of growth in TR and PR populations.
- Identified seasonal and yearly patterns in immigrant data.
- Preliminary satisfactory accuracy is achieved for short term forecasts (1-3 years).


## How to Run the Project(generalized)

It can run Streamlit forecasting app locally

```
Clone repository
git clone <repository_link>
cd project-folder

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
