# IRCC Population Forecasting Project: Predicting Temporary and Permanent Residents in Canada

## 📖 Project Description
A team together with Immigration Refugees Citizenship Canada (IRCC) conducts this project which analyzes past population data to predict the future numbers of Temporary Residents (TR) and Permanent Residents (PR) in Canada. This project provides strategic and policy-making assistance through its derived insights to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada authorities.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Examine previous records regarding Temporary Residents and Permanent Residents in Canada.
- The project develops forecasting models which produce predictions about TR and PR population growth for future times.
- A user-friendly interaction tool(eg., dashboard/streamlit app)should be created for interactive visualization of predictions.
- The project delivers fieldable recommendations for helping IRCC direct their resources while making effective planning policies.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Data Collection and Initial Exploration
- [x] Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [x] Predictive Model Development
- [x] Integration of advanced forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, Machine Learning models)


### Upcoming Tasks:
- [ ] Development of an interactive visualization tool
- [ ] Model Validation and Optimization
- [ ] Deployment of the finalized application
- [ ] User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## 🛠️ Methodology & Technologies
- **Data Analysis & Modeling**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Interactive Tools**: To be determined (e.g., Streamlit, Dash)
- **Collaboration Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code

## 📈 Predictive Modeling
We plan to apply multiple forecasting techniques, including:
- Time Series Models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
- Regression-based models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Baseline models will be established, and performance comparisons will be conducted to select the most reliable forecasting method.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
Detailed instructions to run the forecasting visualization tool will be provided once the final deliverable is decided.

In general, the setup will involve:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository_link>
cd IRCC_Project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application (dashboard or Streamlit)
# Specific instructions to be updated here.
